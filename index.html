                Sportsbooks frequently offer new users a refund for their first losing bet, however, this refund is in the form of site credit.
                This credit (equal to the amount of the losing wager up to a specified limit), is not withdrawable until it has been "played through" or "rolled over".  
            </p>
            <p>   
                This means that when a sportsbook offers a "risk-free bet up to $1,000" and your $1,000 bet loses, then you would get $1,000 in site credit that you then have to wager again.
                Additionally, site credit does not payout in the same manner as a normal wager.
                Since you are "staking" $1,000 of credit (i.e. their money, not yours), then you only receive the winnings from the credited bet.
                Essentially, if you win your credited bet you are still at risk of losing money!
                <br></br>
                In this three-step guide, we will cover how to navigate these conditions to make a truly risk-free wagering strategy that yields
                <b><em>a minimum 22.05% ROI with absolutely zero risk!</em></b>
            </p>
            <h4>Requirements:</h4>
            <p>
                Two sportsbooks that offer the same "risk-free bet" amount.

            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>

        <section class="col-12">
            <h4 id="step1">Step 1) Deposit</h4>
            <p>
                In this example, we will be participating in the Fanduel and Barstool promos.  Each are $1,000 risk-free bet offers with no need for a promo code, simply deposit and wager $1,000 as your first bet.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img class="col-12" src="./assets/images/step-1-deposit.png">
            </div>
            <h4 id="step2">Step 2) The First Wager</h4>
            <p>
                The entire premise of this strategy is to bet both sides of an event, so regardless of outcome you can secure a profit.
                The first wager will be with <em>your</em> deposited funds, so any winning wager will payout a "To Win" amount + "original stake".
                In this example, we are betting on Over/Under for the Nov. 25, 2022 Baylor vs Texas college football game.
                The event listing for each site is shown below:
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img class="col-12" src="./assets/images/step-2-first-wager.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                In the following table, you can see the breakdown of ALL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.  
                An important note is that any text which is
                <span class="green"> green</span>
                will represent funds in a sportsbook account that is withdrawable.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img class="col-12" src="./assets/images/step-3-first-wager-breakdown.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                To further summarize the above table, we have two outcomes that result in an immediate and sizable profit.
                This is due to selecting an event where there is a discrepancy between the two sportsbooks.
                These immediately profitable outcomes are only present if you are able to find an event where the discrepancy allows for both outcomes (Over & Under) to be correct.
                Typically, the other two of the four possible outcomes will be the only two possible scenarios.
                These two other scenarios lead to a winning wager and a losing (but insured) wager.
                To "play-through" our insurance, we require a second event to wager on.
            </p>
            <h4 id="step3">Step 3) The Second (and final) Wager</h4>
            <p>
                The scenario at this point is one account with a $1,000 free bet and another account with at least $1,869.57 in WITHDRAWABLE cash.
                Remember, though, if we lose the free-bet and withdraw the $1,869.57 then the total profit = -$132.43.
                <b>This is why we must hedge the risk of the free-bet losing!</b>
                By taking <em>some</em> of the withdrawable money and wagering on the opposite side of the free bet, we ensure the payout for this second event regardless of the event's outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bet, however, is typically confusing to new users.
                Let's clear up this confusion by continuing our example scenario.
                We will be placing our risk-free bet and hedging the outcome for a second event (Bears vs Jets):
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img class="col-12" src="./assets/images/step-4-second-wager.png">
            </div>
            <p class="orange text-center">
                The orange selections represent the path forward if the first event's outcome was a score UNDER 54.5 points.
            </p>
            <p class="purple text-center">
                The purple selections represent the path forward if the first event's outcome was a score OVER 54.5 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both paths rely on the same premise of maximizing the "To Win" amount for the free bet by wagering on positive odds (+200).
                Then, we hedge the other side of the wager (Jets winning) to payout the same amount as the "To Win" amount for the free bet.
                It's as simple as that.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center">
                <img class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 m-1" src="./assets/images/step-5-second-wager-scenario-1.png">
                <img class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 m-1" src="./assets/images/step-5-second-wager-scenario-2.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                After the Bears vs Jets event, we will be able to withdraw ALL funds.
                The comprehensive total is then outlined below, where our <b>minimum profit = 22.05% of the original deposits</b>.
